"""Path-filter computation for the test-suite workflow.

Replaces the third-party ``dorny/paths-filter`` action. Reads the set
of changed files for the current event from ``$CHANGED_FILES_LIST``
(one path per line) and writes ``<filter>=true|false`` lines to
``$GITHUB_OUTPUT``. If ``$CHANGED_FILES_LIST`` is unset or points at a
missing file, every filter is forced to ``true`` (safe fallback for
events without a meaningful diff base).

The ``FILTERS`` dict is the single source of truth for what each
subsystem-scoped CI job depends on. ``.github/tests/test_filter_coverage.py``
imports it directly to verify that every ``core.*`` / ``packages.*``
import made by a subsystem's source is covered by the corresponding
filter's globs.
