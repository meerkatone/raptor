"""Bridge between raptor and raptor-sca for agentic and sandboxed runs.

Provides:

  - :func:`_find_sca_agent` — discover the raptor-sca entry point.
    Returns the resolved path to ``packages/sca/agent.py`` in the
    raptor-sca tree, or ``None`` if raptor-sca is not installed.

  - :func:`run_sca_subprocess` — launch raptor-sca as a sandboxed
    subprocess with egress routed through the proxy.  The hostname
    allowlist is :data:`packages.sca.SCA_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

Used by ``raptor_agentic.py`` Phase 1b::

    from packages.sca.agent import _find_sca_agent, run_sca_subprocess
    agent = _find_sca_agent()
    if agent:
        rc, stdout, stderr = run_sca_subprocess(agent, target, out, ...)

And by the raptor-side ``packages/sca/__init__.py`` for the canonical
host list (the old basic-scan functions are retained for backward compat
with existing tests).
