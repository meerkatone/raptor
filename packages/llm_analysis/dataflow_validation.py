"""IRIS-style dataflow validation for /agentic Semgrep findings.

Pattern (from IRIS, ICLR 2025): Semgrep flags a finding; the LLM analysis
step claims a dataflow path ("input flows from source to sink"); we
validate the claim by generating a CodeQL query and running it against
a pre-built database. Confirmed → finding stands; refuted → downgrade
exploitability with the audit trail intact; inconclusive → no change.

Why this works (from IRIS results): Semgrep is good at syntactic patterns
but doesn't track inter-procedural dataflow. The LLM is good at imagining
a dataflow path but not at verifying one exists. CodeQL is good at
verifying dataflow but needs the right source/sink spec. Putting them in
the right roles — Semgrep finds candidates, LLM proposes a CodeQL query,
CodeQL adjudicates — is the IRIS recipe.

This helper is opt-in via /agentic --validate-dataflow. It requires a
pre-built CodeQL database (typically produced by the same /agentic run's
--codeql phase). When the database is unavailable or the budget is
exhausted, the helper is a no-op.

_VALIDATION_TASK_GUIDANCE = """\
TASK: You are validating a Semgrep finding's dataflow claim against a
pre-built CodeQL database. The Semgrep rule pattern-matched on a single
location; the LLM analysis claimed an inter-procedural dataflow path
exists from a source to that location.

Your job is to write a CodeQL query that tests whether that path is
actually reachable in the codebase, not to find all possible
vulnerabilities. Focus the query narrowly on the specific claim.

Recommended shape:
  - For taint claims (input → sink): a TaintTracking::Configuration with
    isSource matching the claimed source kind and isSink matching the
    claimed sink location.
  - For reachability claims (function A reaches function B): a
    PathProblem query over the call graph.

CRITICAL — current CodeQL dataflow API (use exactly this pattern; the
old `class C extends TaintTracking::Configuration` API is REMOVED in
current packs and will NOT compile):

  /**
   * @kind path-problem
   * @id raptor/<descriptive-id>
   */
  import python
  import semmle.python.dataflow.new.DataFlow
  import semmle.python.dataflow.new.TaintTracking
  import semmle.python.dataflow.new.RemoteFlowSources

  module MyConfig implements DataFlow::ConfigSig {
    predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node n) {
      // e.g. n instanceof RemoteFlowSource
    }
    predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node n) {
      // e.g. exists(Call c | c.getFunc().(...) ... and n.asExpr() = c.getArg(0))
    }
  }

  module MyFlow = TaintTracking::Global<MyConfig>;
  import MyFlow::PathGraph

  from MyFlow::PathNode source, MyFlow::PathNode sink
  where MyFlow::flowPath(source, sink)
  select sink.getNode(), source, sink, "<message>"

Key differences from the old API:
  - Define a `module` implementing `DataFlow::ConfigSig`, NOT a class
    extending `TaintTracking::Configuration`.
  - Predicates are NOT `override` (modules don't have inheritance).
  - Wrap the config with `TaintTracking::Global<MyConfig>` to create a
    flow module; PathGraph and PathNode come from THAT module
    (e.g. `MyFlow::PathGraph`, `MyFlow::PathNode`), NOT a standalone
    `DataFlow::PathGraph` import.
  - Final `where` clause uses `MyFlow::flowPath(source, sink)`.

Module-path imports per language:

  PYTHON:    import semmle.python.dataflow.new.{DataFlow, TaintTracking, RemoteFlowSources}
  JAVA:      import semmle.code.java.dataflow.{DataFlow, TaintTracking, FlowSources}
  JS/TS:     import javascript    (DataFlow / TaintTracking are top-level)
  C / C++:   import semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.new.{DataFlow, TaintTracking}
             import semmle.code.cpp.security.FlowSources
  GO:        import semmle.go.dataflow.{DataFlow, TaintTracking}

If the dataflow_summary describes a path that isn't expressible as a
TaintTracking or PathProblem query (e.g. "this function trusts the
caller to validate input"), pick the closest mechanical test and note
the limitation in your reasoning."""

    discovery + run_prebuilt_query path that the full IRIS validator
    uses, but bypasses the eligibility filter, hypothesis builder,

    Returns one of:

                       (broad LocalFlowSource model) and matches=0.
                       The flow is genuinely absent — caller should
                       skip downstream LLM cost.

                       stdlib query with broad model returned 0
                       matches, which doesn't justify refutation).

    pass — is essentially free after the first invocation.
