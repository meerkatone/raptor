"""Canonical test-path classification.

Single source of truth for "does this file path look like test or fixture
content?" — used by the diff extractors to populate
``FileChange.is_test``. Before this module existed, three separate
``_TEST_PATH_RE`` definitions in ``cve_diff/diffing/`` disagreed on edge
cases like ``fixtures/`` and ``*.test.*``, causing the same file to be
classified differently depending on which extractor handled the CVE
(2026-05-01 bug surfaced by the simplifier-pipeline Stage 2 dry-run).

The pattern below is the **strict union** of the two divergent regexes
that previously coexisted — i.e., a path is "test" if EITHER of the old
patterns already classified it that way. No path that both old patterns
agreed was non-test gets re-classified.

The classifier is deliberately **extension-agnostic**: ``test_*`` and
``*_test.*`` filenames match regardless of suffix because legitimate
test fixtures use ``.txt`` / ``.json`` / ``.bin`` / etc. as often as
``.py`` / ``.go`` / ``.c``. Callers that need source-language filtering
should compose with their own extension check.

Module renamed from ``test_path.py`` to ``path_classifier.py`` (2026-05-02)
to stop pytest's default ``test_*.py`` collection rule from picking up
application code.
