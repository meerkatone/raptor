# /exploit - Generate Exploit PoCs (beta)

Generate working exploit proof-of-concepts for vulnerabilities.

**Requires:** SARIF file from previous /scan

**What it does:**
- Analyzes findings with LLM
- Generates working exploit code (Python, C, pwntools)
- Saves to out/*/exploits/
- Does NOT generate patches (use /patch for that)

**Run:** `python3 raptor.py agentic --repo <path> --sarif <sarif-file> --no-patches --max-findings <N>`

**Example:**
```bash
/scan test/                    # First, find vulnerabilities
/exploit                       # Then, generate exploits for findings
```

**Note:** Exploits are for educational/research purposes only.
