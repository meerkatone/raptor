"""Per-provider auth-header injection rules.

Each provider's authentication scheme is a small fact: which headers
to strip from the worker's request, which to inject from the parent's
secret store, which upstream URL to forward to. Encoded as data so
adding a provider is a single dict entry plus a credentials-source.

Only providers RAPTOR actively dispatches to are supported here. If
``api_key`` is None at request time, the dispatcher rejects with
``503 Service Unavailable: provider not configured`` so the worker's
SDK surfaces a clear error rather than a mysterious 401 from upstream.
