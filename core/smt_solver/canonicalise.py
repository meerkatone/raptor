"""English-aliased pre-canonicalisation for SMT encoder parsers.

LLM output frequently uses english operator phrases — "is greater than",
"equals", "is at least" — instead of the canonical symbolic forms.
This module applies a small ordered set of regex rewrites *before* the
parser sees the input, mapping common english forms to ``>``, ``<``,
``>=``, ``<=``, ``==``, ``!=`` (with NULL / 0 specialisations for the
``is null`` / ``is zero`` / ``is non-null`` / ``is non-zero`` family).

Coverage at a glance:
- Relational: ``is greater than``, ``is less than``, ``is at least``,
  ``is at most``, ``is greater than or equal to``, ``is less than or
  equal to``, ``exceeds``, ``below``, ``does not exceed``, ``up to``.
- Equality: ``equals``, ``is equal to``, ``is not equal to``,
  ``does not equal``.
- Null/zero: ``is null``, ``is zero``, ``is non-null``, ``is non-zero``
  (``-`` and a single space accepted between ``non`` and the noun).

Design intent:
- Rewrites are *additive*: phrases the per-parser grammar already
  recognises (notably one-gadget's native ``is writable`` suffix form
  and bracketed memory references like ``[rsp+0x8]``) are NOT touched
  here, so existing parse paths keep their dedicated rejection
  messages.  The exception is ``is null``: both encoders see the
  rewritten ``== NULL`` form first, but they encode it identically to
  the dedicated grammar would have done.
- Order matters — longer, more-specific phrases are tried before
  shorter ones (``is greater than or equal to`` before ``is greater
  than``; ``does not exceed`` before ``exceeds``).
- Word boundaries (``\\b``) keep rewrites from firing inside
  identifiers (``equalsValue`` must NOT become ``==Value``).
- ``up to N`` is read as inclusive (``<= N``).  Some writers treat it
  as exclusive; the inclusive reading is the convention in maths/CS
  and is documented at the rewrite site.

# specific phrases must precede their shorter prefixes; otherwise the
# shorter pattern eats part of the longer one and leaves a malformed
